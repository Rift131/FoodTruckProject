The approach: UML, Skeleton of the code, writing the code, 

Constructors: After the fields have been established for the class, one constructor is used to establish the class object with fields that are not provided by another class. The second constructor is an overloaded constructor of the first but has parameters set to match the class fields that will be provided by an outside class. You cannot combine fields whose data is sourced from an outside class with data that is sourced locally in the same constructor, hence the need for overloading.
